# Calorie Calculator

This project is a calorie calculator that estimates calories burned during exercise and daily calorie intake. It uses a machine learning model to predict calories burned based on various factors.


## Live Demo

## Machine Learning Model
The calorie burn prediction model was created by:
- Cleaning data
- Performing data analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Testing multiple models
- Selecting Random Forest as the best model
- Tuning the Random Forest model to achieve an RÂ² score of 0.99

## Installation
Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Zeeshan3155/calorie-calculator.git
   cd calorie-calculator
   ```

Download dataset:
- Download dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jijagallery/fitlife-health-and-fitness-tracking-dataset/data 
- Create a "data/" folder in root directory.
- Move dataset to this directory.

Create prediction model:
   ```sh
   python app/model/create_model.py
   ```

### Using Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
    ```sh
    docker build -t calorie-calculator .
    ```

2. Run the container:
    ```sh
    docker run -p 7860:7860 calorie-calculator
    ```

3. Access the app at http://127.0.0.1:7860

### Running with Uvicorn
1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the application:
    ```sh
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860
    ```

3. Access the app at http://127.0.0.1:7860
